    title: 'How to move at Mexico',
    topic: 'Relocating',
    text: 'Even if you are an experienced expat, the process of moving to Mexico will come with challenges. You made the decision to relocate, be it for the warm weather and beautiful scenery or for the lower cost of living. Now, you need to set your relocation plan in motion. As you may be aware, moving abroad is always full of obstacles, before, during, and after your journey. Throughout this time, the first things on your to-do list will have to do with moving, shipping, and storing your household goods. The important things to bear in mind are keeping costs down, avoiding damage and breakages, and receiving your belongings on time. The logistics of moving your belongings to Mexico may be a little confusing at first. There are several transport options available and many guidelines to follow; some of which are out of the ordinary. For example, if you bring an unusual amount of used clothes and shoes, you might have some explaining to do. Citing health reasons, the importation of secondhand clothes and shoes for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited by law. If you have furry family members, you will need detailed information on moving to Mexico with your pets. Remember that moving your pets abroad cannot be done last minute. You need to start prepping them at least a month in advance. If you can, start even earlier, so you don’t risk any surprises. Another important thing to have in mind is what vaccinations are required for Mexico.  We provide the answers for you here. In our comprehensive relocation guide, you will find all the relevant information you require. We have useful tips for every aspect of a relocation, from the early stages of planning your move until you are settling into your new home. As expats ourselves, we know exactly what you will be facing. Are you planning on relocating to sunny, culturally rich, geographically diverse Mexico? As expected, the first obstacle to solve will be your migratory status. If you are wondering how to get Mexican visa or work permit, often the most tedious process in a relocation venture, you are in the right place. The visa application process in Mexico will vary depending on the visa type. To apply to be a temporary resident, the length of your stay should be around six months. However, if you intend on residing there for an extended period of time, the permanent residency visa is your best bet. The visa requirements will also depend on the how long you’re planning on staying. For Residente Temporal,_the main requirement is financial. In simpler words, you must have a certain amount of funds. For _Residente Permanente, you will have to meet more requirements. The Mexican visa costs go from about 4,270 MXN (200 USD) to around 9,650 MXN (450 USD). To find out all the information you need on types of visa, steps and requirements, fees, and more, read our detailed Guide to Visa Types and Work Permit Requirements in Mexico.',

    title: 'Bali for nomads',
    topic: 'Relocating',
    text: 'It is the dream of many, to pack bags, and come to Bali in order to leave behind the old life and settle on this beautiful island. A dream, that thousands of self-employed digital nomads and remote workers have made come true in recent years. The digital nomad life style is attractive; “working online and living on a tropical island, getting paid to a bank account outside of Indonesia, not paying any taxes, having clients from all over the world.” There are several factors that give rise to the “digital nomad phenomena” in Bali. Remote working for another company in general boomed because of the covid restrictions and more and more companies allow their workers, or even encourage them to work from “anywhere”. And studies show, that workers are very open to the idea of breaking the chains of an office job at home and would, at least for a few months per year, would consider to somewhere else. Furthermore, websites such as freelancer.com, guru.com and others, have made it much easier for freelancers to find jobs and handle projects, regardless of where they live. This lead to a rising number of “self-employed digital nomads” finally able to make a living and create a stable income. Relocating to Indonesia (or any foreign country) and choosing the life as a self-employed digital nomad, is not that simple due to tax implications, visa regulations and medical insurance coverage. You will encounter enthusiastic individuals, “influencers”, communities, and dedicated websites & apps, who boldly promote the “digital nomad life” while naively or deliberately overlooking the details and potential traps that are still existing today. They make it seem, as if there are no laws to follow. That might work for a while, and for some, but this can turn into a nightmare rather quickly. ',

    title: 'Nanotechnology',
    topic: 'Science',
    text: 'Nanotechnology, also shortened to nanotech, is the use of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale for industrial purposes. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defined nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage, engineering,[ microfabrication,and molecular engineering. The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale. Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.',

    title: 'Black holes',
    topic: 'Science',
    text: 'A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly. Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of "black hole" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971. Black holes of stellar mass form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies. The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Any matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shredded into streamers that shine very brightly before being swallowed. If other stars are orbiting a black hole, their orbits can determine the black hole mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars.',
